    <h1>A to-do list is a list of things to do or what you want to do.</h1>
<!--     Traditionally, they are written on a piece of paper and organized in order of priority. When a task is completed, it is usually struck off the list. -->
<!--     But such a list can be kept not only on a piece of paper, but also in electronic form, for example, in a browser. -->
<!--      -->
<!--     TodoList is the name of the project I created to keep my to-do list. He wrote it in HTML, CSS, Angular -->
<!--     TodoList uses ddd to store tasks -->
<!--      -->
<!--     TodoList allows you to: -->
<!--      -->
<!--     add new tasks to the list; -->
<!--     mark completed tasks (in this case, they are immediately excluded from the list of active tasks and transferred to completed); -->
<!--     remove items; -->
<!--     switch between cases (active, completed and new); -->
<!--     add comments to tasks, as well as delete or edit them; -->
<!--     automatically save to-do lists in ddd (necessary to restore the last state of the list when you reopen the page). -->
